We're going to use test driven development (TDD) to write a set of methods that will help us organize and choose our electives for the school year. Go ahead and click `Open in Nitrous` to get started on this lab. The file where you will write your code is called `elective.rb` and the tests are in the `spec` directory in a file called `elective_spec.rb`.

As you work, remember to constantly run `learn` in terminal from the lab's main directory. It's how you'll test that you're getting the correct outcomes!

Here is the [documentation](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.1/Array.html) on arrays if you need some help. 

You're also going to need to use `iteration` for some of the answers. There are many different ruby methods that act out iteration, but we'll be using the `each` method for now. 

Here is an example of how to use `each`:
```ruby
candies = ["snickers", "milkyway", "reeses"]

candies.each do |candy|
  puts "I love #{candy} so much!"
end
```

The `each` method always requires the `do` and `end` keywords. The `|candy|` that you see is the declaration of a variable called `candy` that represents each individual item in the array. In this `each` code block we are iterating through the array and printing out how much we love each candy in the array.
